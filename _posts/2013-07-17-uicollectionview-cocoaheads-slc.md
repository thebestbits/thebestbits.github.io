For those of you who were able to attend my UICollectionView presentation at CocoaHeads SLC on the 2nd of July here is the sample code I promised. Those of you who weren't there, sorry you missed it. My slides aren't really worth publishing. If you are interested in some great presentations on UICollectionView, check out the [2012 WWDC session videos](https://https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2012/).

[Here is the code](https://github.com/derrh/cards). In addition to the two layouts that I demoed at the presentation, I added a parallex layout for your enjoyment.
